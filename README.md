# Coal Dust Mod

Adds coal dust to be able to craft diamonds.

## So what is the job of this mod?

Well, I am mostly playing with a big chunk of tech mods and I don't enjoy mining that much, but I don't like cheating either.  So I came up with that idea to create a mod to be able to craft diamonds. I am currently thinking about balancing the mod a bit more.

My first try to balance crafting of diamonds is the fact that you will need a block of glass with 4 Coal Dust in the middle of your crafting table and one coal dust for each direction , but I am currently thinking about making it more challenging to use. Until then I won't push that project
