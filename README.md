# Coal Dust Mod

Adds coal dust to be able to craft diamonds.

## So what is the job of this mod?

I am playing with a lot of tech mods and I don't really enjoy mining that much, so I thought about creating a little shortcut and so I wrote this little mod, which allows you to craft Coal Dust from Coal. 
 
You will need 1 block of Glass and 4 Coal Dust (or Coal Powder from EnderIO) to craft a artificial Diamond. This is because of balancing and making it a bit more challenging to craft artificial diamonds. You can use the Diamonds to craft tools, because of this awesome thing called OreDictionary. 
 
Maybe I will take a look at balancing the mod a bit more and adding some machinery to it.
